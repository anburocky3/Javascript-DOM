# How can I find the number of elements (length) in the `HTML Collection`?	

<v-clicks>

To find the number of elements in HTML collection, we have to use `length` properties.

```html {1-8|9,13|10|12|all}
 <p>This is paragraph one.</p>

<p>This is paragraph two.</p>

<p>This is paragraph three.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
    const x = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x.length;
</script>
```

<br class="my-10"/>
