# How to insert dom elements in a `performant` way?	

<v-clicks>

`documentFragment` a very lightweight or minimal part of a DOM or a subtree of a DOM tree. It is very helpful when you are manipulating a part of DOM for multiple times. It becomes expensive to hit a certain portion of DOM for hundreds time. You might cause reflow for hundred times. Stay tuned for reflow.

If you are changing dom that cause expensive reflow, you can avoid it by using documentFragment as it is managed in the memory.

```js {1|3|5,10|6|7|8|9|12|all}
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();

let list = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'other-multiple-values'], el, text;

for (let i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
    el = document.createElement('li');
    text = document.createTextNode(list[i]);
    el.appendChild(text);
    fragment.appendChild(el);
}

document.body.appendChild(fragment);
```
