# What is NodeList in DOM?	

<v-click>

A NodeList object is a list (collection) of nodes extracted from a document.

A NodeList object is almost the same as an HTMLCollection object.

</v-click>


<v-click>

#### How to get that?

```html
<div>
    <p>Hello CyberDude,</p>
</div>
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```js
const myNodeList = document.querySelectorAll("p");
```

</v-click>

<br class="py-10"/>

<v-click>

The elements in the NodeList can be accessed by an index number.
To access the second `<p>` node you can write:

```js
myNodeList[1]
```

</v-click>
