# What is `event object`?	

<v-clicks>

All event objects in the DOM are based on the Event Object.

Therefore, all other event objects (like `MouseEvent` and `KeyboardEvent`) has access to the Event Object's properties and methods.

Some of the mostly used event object properties:

- `event.target`
- `event.currentTarget`

Some of the mostly used event object methods:

- `event.preventDefault()`
- `event.stopPropagation()`
