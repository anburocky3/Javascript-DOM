# What is DOM?

The DOM is known as Document object model and it allows the accessing of the documents like HTML and XML.

- 📝 **Text-based** - It allows a platform to be language neutral and provide an interface that allows the dynamic usage of the scripts and programs to access the content.
- 🎨 **Themable** - It also provides a way to update the content, structure and style of the document and a way to represent it in any language.
- 🧑‍💻 **Developer Friendly** - It is used with the language and used to create the objects that can be used as a model to allow the interface to be developed with ease.
