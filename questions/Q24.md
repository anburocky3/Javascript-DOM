# What is the `HTML DOM collection`, Explain with example?	

<v-clicks>

HTML DOM collection is similar to an `array`, but it is `not an array`. HTML DOM Collection is an `object` which is  a collection of specific HTML elements.

```html {1-8|9,13|10|12|all}
<p>This is paragraph one.</p>

<p>This is paragraph two.</p>

<p>This is paragraph three.</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
const x = document.getElementsByTagName("p");

document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x[2].innerHTML;
</script>
```

<br class="my-10"/>
