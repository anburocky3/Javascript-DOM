# Why can't we use forEach or similiar array methods on a NodeList?	

<v-click>

Both array and nodeList have length and you can loop through elements but they are not same object.

Both are inherited from Object. However array has different prototype object than nodeList. `forEach`, `map`, etc are on `array.prototype` which doesn't exist in the `NodeList.prototype` object. Hence, you don't have `forEach` on a nodeList

### How to solve it?

To solve this problem, We can use the spread operator to convert the NodeList to an array, then we can use forEach or any other array method we want with the NodeList. We can do this since itâ€™s an array-like object.

```html
<div>foo</div>
<div>bar</div>
<div>baz</div>
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

Then we can get and loop through the divs by running:

```js
[...document.querySelectorAll('div')].forEach(div => console.log(div.textContent));
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```js
foo // output
bar
baz
```
