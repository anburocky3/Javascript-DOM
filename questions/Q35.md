# What is `event delegation` and write an sample program explaining it.	

**Problem:** If you have one hundred list items that have similar event to handle. You can write one hundred event handler (actually copy paste) same code in 99 places. This works but if something changes in the event handler, you have to change in one hundred places. This doesn't call job security. This is called screwed up.

Second problem is if you want to dynamically add a new element, you have to make sure event handler is attached with the new element. More JavaScript code!

```html
<ul id="listToDestroy">
    <li><a href="#">first item</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">second item</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">third item</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">forth item</a></li>
    <li><a href="#">Fifth item</a></li>
</ul>
```
