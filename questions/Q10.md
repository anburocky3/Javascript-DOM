# What is the fastest way to select elements by using css selectors?	

<v-click>

It depends on what you are selecting. If you have an ID of an element getElmentById is the fastest way to select an element. However, you should not have so many ID in you document to avoid style repetition. css class getElementsByClassName is the second quickest way to select an element 

Here is the list. As we go downwards through the list, it takes more time to select elements.

<v-clicks>

- ID (`#myID`), Class (`.myClass`)
- Tag (`div`, `p`)
- Sibling (`div+p`, `div~p`)
- child (`div>p`)
- Descendant (`div p`)
- Universal (`*`)
- Attribute (`input[type="checkbox"]`)
- Pseudo (`p:first-child`)
